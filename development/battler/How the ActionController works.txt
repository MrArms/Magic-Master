An Action is an action that takes place that needs an animation and needs resolving
	eg. A unit attacks 4 cells with a spell
	A unit starts a status effect eg. Action.POISON_STATUS_START
	
GameEvent - this is something that happens to an actor - move, take damage, die, attack



So a spell attacks four cells with a poison spell
	This is added as an action to the ActionController
		The Action controller gets gameEvents for the attack -> this is 4 attack gameEvents
				An array of gameEvents with these four things is created
			These are resolved on the actors (reduced HP) and say one dies and four animEvents are created
					3 poison damage and 1 poison damage and death
				These are sent back and we wait for a callback to tell us that the anims have been completed 
				
				
Wizard casts poison spell at four cells
	plays wizard casting animation
		Wait for animation callback
	Four enemies get hit by the spell - it is resolved on the code side and a new action is created of a counter-attack from one of the enemies
		Also the following animations are created below:
		1) Quick particle anim and then the damage appears 
		2) Quick particle anim and then damage and at the same time green status effect appears
		3) Quick particle anim and then the damage appears and at the same time the enemy dies
		4) Quick particle anim and then the damage appears
		
		The actors are resolved first before we can see the animation
			The animator sorts out the order of everything
		
		Then the actionController waits for the animations to finish above
		
		Then it deals with the new Action of the counter attack
