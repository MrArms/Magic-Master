Need currently selected actor (if any)
	Make actorView a button that inherit from the Button class
Also current actor to move


Create a side panel that shows stats for the currently selected actor
	Click on actors to show information for that actor
	Need a "ready to move" indicator if it is the next one to move

Make battle area a separate displayObject

ActorView needs to inherit from your displayObject





Have a separate gridView rather than added to the gameView
	
Also have a gameUIView	

Fix the bug with the wrong actor to move being highlighted DONE

Then add the timePoints and animation for actor becoming ready to move DONE

Sort out pause/play button DONE



The game loop
	Do we want each actor to move once per "turn" with just the fastest going first....or something else? Maybe FF7 style timings
	
Make the ActorView derive from the button and have callbacks for selection
	Maybe you can't click them until the game is paused (either you click pause or it pauses naturally when an actor is ready)
		Add move buttons on the right and some info when an actor is selected 
			Attack
	
	

	
Create interactionLayerManager and add to GameView
	Think about how inputs are entered, have a separate input class perhaps?
		Sends to the battle part of the screen or the side bar etc.

Create displayObject class and derive other things from it where necessary
	addToParent
	destroy
	setVisible
	getWidth
	getHeight
	setPosition	

Create GameAnimation class DONE
Create Action class 
	Holds information about the action
	
Process action for melee attack
	update actors
	add gameAnimations
	add counter-attack to test ActionController
	
Creating main gameLoop with toggle for play/pause
	
	
	
Resolve simple attack in ActionController and pass GameAnimations to the GameController 
Make GameView hold the ActorViews for each actor when created in GameController (store a copy of the grid that is in the GameController)
Pass this on from the GameController to the GameView
Create GameView taking animations and passing them to the relevant ActorView to be animated (simple different colour rectangle with timer and callback)	
	GameView needs a list of all animations to process and only callback when all of them are completed
		Callback to the GameController which then calls the ActionController to say all the animations are completed
				
GameController
	Need main game loop whereby all units are cycled through and the next one to move gets selected
	Have pause and play button at the side to stop/start this process
	When a unit is ready to move then the timer stops and a new animation for selection is created that gets sent to the GameView and waits for callback
		When this is completed then we check which player is ready to move
			For now just allow both to be controlled with the mouse, but later on we will have the option of AI or human
	
		Think about how inputs are going to work, maybe an input controller? Maybe something else....
		Also think about menus....
		
		
Want animation for unit ready to move
